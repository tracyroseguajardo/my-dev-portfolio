## Description
Welcome to my portfolio! I have used React.js to build out a dynamic application with reusable components that can be injected into the different views. Each page has a header, a footer, and a place for the main content. Here you can read all about me, send me a message, and most importantly view some of my projects with links to their deployed applications and to the Github repositories. Thank you for taking a look.
