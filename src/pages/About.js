                Tracy Rose Guajardo is a gal that has always worked with her hands. Whether it be tending to animals, baking a pie, or carving wax models to be cast in sterling silver. She owes these gifts to her ancestors, a lineage of strong chicano field workers and artisans.

                Tracy has a BFA in mixed media sculpture. It might seem that pursing a career in web development would be too much of a contrast to her very tactile way of living. However Tracy knows that there is artistry and touch that can be brought to all things. She is confident that she will provide you with a depth of services that are rooted in an artist's perspective that is firmly grounded in this sensual world. This is just storytelling in a new medium. A new fire to gather our gleaming faces around.
